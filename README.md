# Santa Web Server


This was an experimental project I undertook over my Christmas break (thus the name).

## Q&A:

*Should I use this?*
No. This is not meant to be used in any actual production setting. Ever!

*Does it support [xyz]?*
Probably not. This is very bare bones.

*Why make this?*
I made this in order to practice and learn more about how the http protocol actually works, and the difficulties that come with it. I could have made it a lot more robust. I could have supported more back end languages. I could have done a lot more with this project, and maybe someday I will, but a lot of that is outside the scope of what I wanted to learn and achieve. I am posting this online not because I believe it is very good, but rather because it could potentially help somebody trying to learn similar things down the road.

- php-cgi (for php support)
